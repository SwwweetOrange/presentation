# More breakthrough ideas
<div mb-5>
Creativity happens when you mash seemingly unrelated concepts together to form a new idea. Neuroscientists call this <span font-bold text-blue>synaptic play</span>, and the more incongruent the concepts are, the more synapses occur in your brain. Working in a different place everyday gives you a lot of diverse experiences that you call pull from to make these creative connections. And when your brain is chock full of these diverse inputs, your ideas are much more inventive.
